What you need:
====================================
ROOT 5.34/35+
gcc compiler(general)


Source codes:
====================================
Located in src directory...

TDISMC_EIC.cpp  :  pion structure function with ep scattering at JLEIC
TDISMC_EICn.cpp :  pion structure function with eD scattering at JLEIC
TDISMC_EICK.cpp :  kaon structure function with ep scattering at JLEIC
cteq/           :  cteqpdf.h and data based call files (c++ wrapper)
cteq-tbls/      :  nucleon PDFs table
tim_hobbs/      :  various regularization form for pion FF 


How to run:
====================================
./run_batch.sh <scattered particle> ; Only pion is currently updated


How to change inputs:
====================================
Located in inputs directory...

kinematics.inputs : edit this document to change simulation kinematics (e.g. number of events, x range, Q2 range, pbeam, kbeam)

* All other constants are changed in src/TDISMC_EIC(k,n).h


Plotting:
====================================
The plots spit out as rootfiles. I convert these root files to numpy arrays since I prefer python.
