What you need:
====================================
ROOT 5.34/35
gcc compiler(general)






Codes:
====================================
TDISMC_EIC.cpp  :  pion structure function with ep scattering at JLEIC
TDISMC_EICn.cpp :  pion structure function with eD scattering at JLEIC
TDISMC_EICK.cpp :  kaon structure function with ep scattering at JLEIC
cteq/           :  cteqpdf.h and data based call files (c++ wrapper)
cteq-tbls/      :  nucleon PDFs table
tim_hobbs/      :  various regularization form for pion FF 






How to run:
====================================
./run_batch.sh <scattered particle> ; Only pion is currently updated

To change the number of events, beam energies, polarizations, etc.: TDISMC_EIC.h


Plotting:
====================================
The plots spit out as rootfiles. I convert these root files to numpy arrays since I prefer python.
If you prefer root then you need to comment out "python roothist2numpy.py" from run_batch.sh script!
